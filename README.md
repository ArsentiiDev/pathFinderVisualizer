It's a pathFinder visualizer using React, Typescript, and Chakra UI.

It's pretty straightforward and self-explanative. 
The Project utilizes Dijkstra and A* algorithms to find the shortest path between two nodes.

Added maze generation algorithm, using recursive backtracking algorithm

Added different "materials" with other weights: ground, water, and walls. 
So you can build your own land and find the path between two nodes.

All Pathfinding algorithms are optimized with MinHeap for better performance.
